# Reusable CSS Components

This is a collection of vanilla CSS animations, transitions, hover effects, components etc that I find useful and use often and believe would be useful to other frontend developers out there. It is done in vanilla CSS an not SCSS simply because people might not know or understand SASS.

## How it works

A new folder is created for every code snippet. A HTML file and a CSS file. Each folder has a readme stating exactly what the component does.

## Use with frameworks or libraries

I believe use with frameworks or libraries is also pretty straightforward as most libraries or frameworks use vanilla CSS so it really isn't that difficult to convert this to your favorite.
