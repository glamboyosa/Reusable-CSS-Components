# Reusable CSS Components

This is a collection of vanilla CSS animations, transitions, hover effects, components etc that I find useful and use often and believe would be useful to other frontend developers out there.

## How it works

A new folder is created for every code snippet. A HTML file and a CSS file. Each folder has a readme stating exactly what the component does.

## Use with frameworks or libraries

I believe use with frameworks or libraries is pretty straightforward as libraries or frameworks use plain old CSS as default, as such, it really isn't that difficult to adapt this for use in your preferred framework or library.
