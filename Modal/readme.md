# Modal

A simple modal using CSS. I do not implement how to close the modal because this is strictly CSS but some ideas are:

- In vanilla JavaScript, have a button and onClick translate it out of the page and set it's opacity to 0.
- In React have a backdrop component which the modal is placed on top of and onClick set some state and translate it out of the page and set opacity to 0.
- In React have a button on modal and onClick set some state and translate it out of the page and set opacity to 0.
